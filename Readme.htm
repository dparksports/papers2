<h3 id="inside">What's in This eBook</h3> 

<p><b>Deeds for California Real Estate</b> is a file you use with software programs that are already installed on your computer. When you successfully expand the archive file &quot;DEEDC.ZIP,&quot; save it to a folder or directory on your hard disk (we recommend saving it to C:\Deeds). Since this is not a software program in and 
of itself, you will not run a set up or create icons, and no icons or program groups are added to the Start Menu (Windows) or your computer's desktop (Macintosh).</p>
 
<p>The expanded archive contains all components of this eBook:</p>

<h3 id="use">Using This eBook</h3>
<p>This eBook is in PDF format and is intended to be viewed using Adobe <i>Reader</i>. Your best source for help using Reader is its online help (accessible
through Reader's <b>Help</b> menu). Below, however, you will find some specific tips on using Nolo eBooks.</p>

<h4>Opening the Book</h4>
<p>Find the main file &quot;Deeds.pdf&quot; in the directory/folder you created when you initially expanded the Zip archive file. The default folder is C:\Deeds. Double-click the file &quot;Deeds.pdf.&quot; This should launch Adobe <i>Reader</i> and open the eBook.</p>

<h4>Navigating Within This eBook</h4>
<p>Standard Adobe <i>Reader</i> navigation features allow you to browse through a PDF with relative ease. If you do not know how to navigate within a PDF file, please consult <i>Reader</i>'s online help (accessible through its <b>Help</b> menu).</p> 

<p>In addition to the standard <i>Reader</i> navigation, we've added the following features to your eBook to make it easier to use:</p>

<blockquote>

<em>The Electronic Table Of Contents (Bookmarks)</em> 
<p>On the left side of the eBook, there is an electronic table of contents. <i>Reader</i> calls these headings <b>bookmarks</b>. When you click on a bookmark, the eBook will open to the corresponding page of the book.</p>

<em>Links</em>
<p>Most Nolo references in this eBook are links set in blue text. Clicking a Nolo weblink launches your web browser and takes you to a page on the Nolo web site.</p>

<p>NOTE: URL links to non-Nolo websites have not been provided. Because things change rapidly and without warning on the Internet, we can't guarantee that all URLs are still live or accurate. You can, however, copy the text of a non-Nolo URL and paste it into your browser.</p>

<h3 id="forms">Filling in RTF Forms Using Your Word Processor</h3>

<p>The form files in rich text format (RTF) can be read by most recent word processing programs for Windows and Macintosh, including Microsoft <i>Word</i>, <i>WordPad</i>, and <i>WordPerfect</i>.</p>

<p>To create your own documents: </p>

<ol>
<li> open a file in your word processor </li>
<li> edit the form by filling in the required information, following the instructions in the eBook </li>
<li> print it out, and </li>
<li> save your revised file. </li>
</ol>

<p>For questions about how to use your word processor, consult the help provided for your word processing program. Nolo is unable to answer questions about
other companies' products.</p>

<h4>Opening a Form File</h4>

<p>All forms can be directly accessed from Adobe <i>Reader</i>. The RTF files are indexed in the electronic table of contents (bookmarks) of the main book file (&quot;Deeds.pdf&quot;) under the heading &quot;Forms From the CD-ROM.&quot; Click the name of the form you wish to open and, if you have a word processor installed, 
<i>Reader</i> will launch that program and open the file you clicked.</p>

<p>If you have problems opening the files from <i>Reader</i>, launch your word processing program, and then try opening the files again from <i>Reader</i>, as described above.</p>

<p>If you are still having problems, open the form files from the Forms folder. Use <b>My Computer</b> or <b>Windows Explorer</b> (Windows <i>XP</i>, <i>Vista</i>, or <i>7</i>) or the <b>Finder</b> (Macintosh) to go to the Deeds\Forms directory. Then, double-click the specific RTF file you want to open.</p> 

<p>If the file isn't loaded, or if it contains garbage characters, use your word processor's "Open" command. This opens a dialog box in which you will tell the program (1) the type of file you want to open (*.RTF) and (2) the location and name of the file. (You will need to navigate to C:\Deeds\Forms).</p>

<p>For a list of all of the forms included in the Forms folder, see <a href="#list"> above</a>.</P>

<h4>Editing Your Document</h4>

<p>Fill in the appropriate information according to the instructions in &quot;Deeds.pdf.&quot; Brackets are used to indicate where you need to enter your information; Inside the brackets are instructions on what information needs to be inserted. To find these quickly, use your word processor's search command to go to the next blank by searching for a left bracket character ([). Once you've created your document, delete the bracketed instructions.</p>

<p>Where there are alternative clauses or language within a form, choose the one that applies to your situation and delete the clauses that do not apply. In some instances, you will have to renumber the paragraphs that follow deleted clauses. Also, delete any optional language you do not wish to include.</p>

<h4>Saving Your Document</h4>

<p>After filling in the form, use the <b>save as</b> command to give the file a new name and save it. These files are read-only so you will need to rename it before saving it. By doing so, you will be able to create additional documents using the same form files.</p> 

<p>If you have additional questions about using your word processing program, consult the help it provides. Nolo is unable to answer questions about other companies' software.</p>
